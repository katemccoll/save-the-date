                    We are excited to start our lives together, and we are thankful
                    for our loved ones. As we enter our marriage, we realize that
                    we have enough belongings. Therefore, we have decided to plan
                    the honeymoon of our dreams. Our wedding registry includes a
                    honeymoon fund along with personalized experiences — such as
                    excursions, date nights, and spa days — that can be given as wedding
                    gifts. We are excited to share our special day with you, and
                    we also look forward to providing glimpses into our honeymoon
                    when we return. Thank you!</p>
